Linked Hashset?

What if the lists of possible tiles were just a long line of bits. Could I do something with NAND to make .removeAll faster (making list stuff easier in general)
-> IDs would have to be powers of 2, then I could use adding and subtracting aswell

do the bit stuff in a C++ thingy (native einbinden)
